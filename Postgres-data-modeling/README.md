# Data Modeling

Creating a database assignment from [Techtonica's curriculum](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/projects/db-modeling-assignment.md).



To view the database:

1. Make sure you have [Postgres installed](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/master/databases/installing-postgresql.md)
2. Once Postgres is installed, create a database called IG-demo by running `CREATEDB IG-demo`
3. Run `psql IG-demo < IG-demo.sql`
