# Mobile App Development

## Types of Mobile Development

###Native: 

Built specifically for that platform (iOS, Android) using the designated language (Swift, Object-C, Java, Kotlin)

**When to use**:

- Your application demands performance and native device functionality. You are OK with an MVP solution of just one platform

**Native device functionality**:

- <u>Access to phone/tablet hardware</u>: camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, bluetooth, graphics engine, wearable connectivity, GPS, etc
- <u>Access to native Frameworks:</u> local database, gaming frameworks, peer to peer networking, contacts, machine learning, etc.

### Web: 

Built once to work on all platforms as it runs in a browser

**When to use**:

- You want to build a quick, universally supported app. You don’t need certain phone/tablet specific functionality. You don’t need high performance.



###Hybrid:

3rd party platforms that write it once and convert it to both, wrapped in a webview

**When to use**:

- (ex. React Native) You need native device functionality or performance, you need to support iOS and Android, and you don’t want to learn (or hire people who know) the inner workings of 2 different platforms and languages.



## Mobile dev vs Web dev

- Development environment: using a powerful IDE like Xcode or Android Studio. 
- Ability to develop most of your UIs in a graphical interface: rapid UI development, aligning and sizing UI elements will also use a type of constraint system that isn’t like CSS at all.
